# TBD...

# INTRO
We will only be using "quanta_copy.py" for now, as we do not use an actual OpenAI API at the moment.
Instead, we use a mock API.

# USAGE
It is specialized for research papers, documentations, or other files that are lengthy.

# INSTALLATION
1. Install Requirements.
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
     
2. Manually insert API key, like this.
   - (macOS / Linux): export OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY'
   - (Windows): set set OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_OPEN_AI_KEY'

3. Launch.
   - python3 -m streamlit run quanta_copy.py

If some of these do not work, try the following.
1. python --> python3
2. pip --> pip3
